# Organizm

A simulation of a dynamic ecosystem filled with evolving species. This project models the lives of various animals as they interact, adapt, and make intelligent decisions over generations.

## Features

- **Evolving Ecosystem**: Animals evolve traits across generations based on environmental conditions.
- **Dynamic Environment**: Weather changes, terrain variations, and resource availability affect animal behavior.
- **Animal Capabilities**: Animals can sleep, eat, move, and mate to reproduce.
- **Visualization**: Real-time visualization of the ecosystem and interactions.
